# The Gentleman

This is a web based application built with business specifications. The Gentleman is a full-stack application that serves the purpose of giving users a wide variety of gentleman fashion that they can view and make an appointment to try it on or negotiate with the seller. Authentication is required i.e all users need to register first to view all the gentleman suits on the site. The application makes use of [The Gentleman API](https://github.com/ClaytonSiby/gentleman-api/tree/feature/gentleman) to authenticate and authorize users and give them access to the resources available on the various endpoints provided. For authentication and authorization, I made use of the JWT standard that generates an auth token to register or login users. For a visual demo of the app in use, please navigate to the Project Design section and get familiar with how to navigate on different routes.

This project follows a [design](https://www.behance.net/gallery/26425031/Vespa-Responsive-Redesign) on behance created by [Murat Korkmaz](https://www.behance.net/muratk).
